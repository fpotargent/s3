pkt-byte, all vector equality functions

down to 5703 bytes (from what ? something put it higher, no idea what)
now 5652, 5641, 5626, 5602, 5570, 5442, 5424, 5413, 5414, 5401, 5395, 5370, 5354, 5337

figure out dependencies for each module

get rid of the -n suffixes

standardize names, for instance, ue only make or create, not a mix of the 2

make sure constants (as in (define x 3)) are really inlined and don't cost more that a simple 3 (simple example to prove it : use both one after the other and check size)

have an a-list for mac-ip associations, kind of arp cache, but maybe without arp, when we send a packet, the address either has to be in the list, or must have sent a message before (we might have a leak if we keep all addresses)

utiliser case, surtout pour dispatch de higher protocols

have vector field equality directly in the vm

test everything to make sure it works

put this version into git

when we bind a port, say for which address, or leave for everyone by default ?

all mentions of options were removed, go see orig to see what there was

CHANGE BUFFERS TO HAVE 2 POINTERS
